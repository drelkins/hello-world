# hello-world
Hello all who have chosen to enter here...

I like tacos, hiking, reading, and spending time with my family.
My favorite sports teams are the Michigan State Spartans (football and hockey), Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Lions, Philadelphia Union, and Arsenal.
I'm also a big fan of PC games, but don't get a lot of time to play.

I also really like tacos. 

Perhaps I am a dragon. 

Please invite me to any future taco parties you may be throwing.

Thanks,
Doug
